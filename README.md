Project Overview:


I’ve created a simple file management system using Node.js and Express. The system allows users to:

Create new text files.
View the contents of those text files.
Edit the filenames of existing text files.
The system uses EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates to render dynamic content, and TailwindCSS for styling. Here’s a breakdown of how all these parts work together:

How it Works:
Homepage (index.ejs):

When the user accesses the homepage, it shows a form to create a new text file. The form has two inputs:
Title: This becomes the filename (spaces are removed).
Details: This is the content of the file.
Below the form, it dynamically lists all the files present in the files folder on the server. Each file is shown as a clickable task with two options:
Read More: This link leads the user to the content of the file.
Edit Filename: This link leads the user to an edit page where they can rename the file.
Create a Task (New File Creation):

Once the user submits the form, a new file is created in the files folder. The title given by the user is used as the filename, and the details are written as the content of the file.
After this, the file is created and the user will be directed to the homepage again to see a list of the files that were created.
View a File (show.ejs):

On the homepage, whenever a user clicks on Read More next to the file, the user is led to the show.ejs page where they are able to view the name of the filename as well as the content.
On this page, the user can view the contents of the file before going back to the homepage.
Edit a Filename (edit.ejs):

This will redirect the user to the edit.ejs page where they can change the name of the file. The page already populates the current filename into a text input field. The user can enter a new name for the file, and once the form is submitted the file will be renamed on the server.
Key Features:
Dynamic File Management: You can create, view, and rename text files from the web interface.
User-Friendly Interface: Using TailwindCSS, the UI is clean and responsive.
Smooth Navigation: With the project, users can seamlessly navigate between file creation, view, and editing using links which will guide the user through each step.
What's Going on Behind the Curtain:
Server Side: Your Express server creates, reads, and renames files using the Node.js fs (File System) module. When a file is created, the server writes it to the disk. When a file is renamed, the server uses the fs.rename() method to change the filename.
Frontend Side: The EJS templates render dynamic content, like the list of files, the content of files, and the form to edit a file. The forms use HTTP POST requests to send data back to the server to process it (for example, to create or rename files).
File Storage: Files are stored in the files directory, and any new file is created there with names depending on user input.
Conclusion
This project gives a file management application that will allow users to create, view, and edit text files from a web interface. It's a great example of how one can build a simple content management system using Node.js, Express, and EJS. This project uses dynamic rendering with EJS templates for file data and server-side file operations with Node.js's fs module for creating, reading, and renaming files.
